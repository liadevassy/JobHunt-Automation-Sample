# JobHunt-Automation-Sample
This is Repository for the code uploaded as sample work

1:This is a sample project to showcase my Selenium skills for my job applications.
2:If you want to try running the program, please hardcode your LinkedIn credentials (though this is not recommended for real-world use).
3:Feel free to modify the role and location to suit your needs.
4:The same logic can be applied to other job portals by adjusting the XPath and CSS selectors.

****warning****
If you wish to run this program, please do so only once or twice to avoid being blocked by LinkedIn due to repeated automated attempts. This program is intended to be run once daily.
